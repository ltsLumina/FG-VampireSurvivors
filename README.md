## Description
A simple clone of the game Vampire Survivors with a working shop, character selection, 4 weapon items, 6 passive items, and 3 different enemies. 
The game is made in Unity 3D.

## How to play
- Use the WASD/Arrow keys to move the player
- Use the mouse to select upgrades upon leveling up or in the shop.
- Survive as long as possible!

## Notice:
- The game is quite technical and has not been tested on multiple PCs.
- There are potentially issues with loading JSON files on different PCs, which leads to some things not being loaded, and subsequently, the game not working as intended.
- I am aware of a bug where Item ScriptableObjects are reset upon opening the project on a different PC.
    - If there are any issues upon opening the project, please let me know and I'll show you how it is meant to work, as it works as intended on my PC.

## Potential Questions
- There are three enemy types, but the third one only spawns after surviving for 3~ minutes.
- The game is meant to be difficult, but the player can get quite strong with the right upgrades.
- Again, if any issues arise, please let me know, because they are not intended and should work on my PC.
